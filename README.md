> A personal collection of PowerShell scripts used for learning, automation, and real-world sysadmin tasks.

## 👋 About

Welcome to my PowerShell lab!  
Here you'll find scripts I've written either as part of real IT operations, personal learning, or fun challenges.  
Most of them are practical tools used for automation, monitoring, cleanup tasks, and Windows system management.

I'm sharing them to document my journey and maybe help others along the way 🚀

## 🧰 Script Categories

- 🗂️ **Active Directory** — user management, password expiration, account updates  
- 🖥️ **System Maintenance** — cleanup tools, temp file removals, etc.  
- 🌐 **Network & Connectivity** — TCP port checks, quick network diagnostics  
- 📦 **Application Deployment** — example scripts like installing Teams  
- 🧪 **Training / Challenges** — scripts written for learning or exercises

## 🛠️ Usage

Each script is documented with inline comments.  
Test everything in a lab or safe environment before applying in production.
